# IT-Expenditure-Analysis
Power Bi Dashboard


This project builds a Power BI dashboard to analyze IT expenditure across regions, business areas, and IT functions using planned, forecasted, and actual cost data.​
Cleaned and modeled data from a two‑sheet Excel file is used to create measures for totals, variances, and percentage deviations (Actual vs Plan, Forecast vs Plan).​
The dashboard includes KPI cards, variance by region charts, trend visuals, a business‑area variance ranking matrix, and distribution views by IT Area and Region.​
Insights show overall IT spend about 38% under plan, while forecasts remain closely aligned with planned budgets, indicating strong cost control and forecasting accuracy.​
Most IT costs are concentrated in the USA and in Infrastructure and Functional IT Areas, with labor emerging as the main cost driver.​
Stakeholders can use the dashboard to drill down into regions, business areas, and cost groups to identify savings opportunities, rebalance budgets, and support strategic IT investment decisions.​
